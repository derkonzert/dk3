  Features
</Title>

<Text mv={3}>
  You don't need an account, to use derkonzert. Everyone can see all events, and
  everyone can submit new events! But of course there are some benefits from
  having an account:
</Text>

<SubTitle mt={4} mb={2}>
  Bookmarks
</SubTitle>

<Text mv={3}>
  As a registered user, you can bookmark important concerts for yourself, to not
  forget about them and have them synced into your calendar.
</Text>
  
<Text mv={3}>
  Try it out yourself here:
</Text>

<State initial={{ bookmarked: false }}>
  {({ state, setState }) => (
    <React.Fragment>
      <EventCard
        bookmarked={state.bookmarked}
        onBookmarkClick={() => setState({ bookmarked: true })}
        title="Awesome Event You Wanna Go To"
        day={0}
        dayName="doom"
        description="Click the bookmark icon on the right!"
      />
      {state.bookmarked && (
        <SuccessMessage mb={3}>
          Hoorray, You've added the "Example Event" to your bookmarks!
        </SuccessMessage>
      )}
    </React.Fragment>
  )}
</State>

<Text mv={3}>
  Additionally, with this bookmarking feature, you actively recommend events to
  all other derkonzert visitors:

  Highlighted Events
</SubTitle>

<Text mv={3}>
  You may have noticed, that some events look a little different in the list.
  This depends on the number of users who have bookmarked it:
</Text>

<EventCard
  mt={4}
  bookmarked
  title="Most Popular Event"
  day={1}
  fancyLevel={2}
  dayName="doom"
  description="Alot users bookmarked this event"
/>

<EventCard
  title="More Popular Event"
  day={2}
  fancyLevel={1}
  dayName="doom"
  description="Many users bookmarked this event"
/>

<EventCard
  title="Regular Popular Event"
  day={3}
  dayName="doom"
  description="Some users bookmarked this event"
/>

<Text mv={3}>
  …that way, you can contribute to derkonzert, by simply marking all events
  you'd like to go to.
</Text>

<SubTitle mt={4} mb={2}>
  Calendar Integration
</SubTitle>

<Text mv={3}>
  If you are using a digital calendar, like e.g. the ones from google, or apple,
  you can have all your bookmarks synced into it.
</Text>

<Text mv={3}>
  <Link href="/account/calendar">Manage calendar integration</Link>
</Text>

<SubTitle mt={4} mb={2}>
  Email Notifications
</SubTitle>

<Text mv={3}>
  You can receive email notifications about freshly submitted events and certain
  updates to your bookmarked events, so that you don't have to check the list
  every day manually.
</Text>

<Text mv={3}>
  In the near future, you can also be notified, if one of your bookmarked events
  get canceled or postponed for some reason.
</Text>

<Text mv={3}>
  <Link href="/account/">Manage notification settings</Link>
</Text>

<SubTitle mt={4} mb={2}>
  Visibility
</SubTitle>

<Text mv={3}>
  If you like, you can have your username next to the events that you submitted
  or bookmarked. This of course depends on your privacy settings: disable the
  feature, and no one will ever see your username or email address.

  Dark Mode
</SubTitle>

<Text mv={3}>
  Just in case, if the current design is too light for you, scroll down to the
  very bottom of this page and switch to "Dark mode"!
</Text>

<Title mv={4}>Who is behind this platform?</Title>

<Text mv={3}>
  Next to many friends, giving me feedback and throwing in their ideas, and all
  the users contributing events to the list, it's me:{" "}

  When I started derkonzert in 2015, it was merely meant as a calendar for
  myself, but it quickly became much more. I discovered alot of new music that I
  love today and that I probably would'nt know, if it wasn't for the awesome
  derkonzert users.
