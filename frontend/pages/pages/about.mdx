# About derkonzert

derkonzert is about concerts in Munich. All concerts and events are picked - or submitted - by real people,
who love music.

This list of concerts is supposed to be an alternative to big websites, that just aggregate everything that's going on
in munich.

## Tod dem Genre

As you may have noticed, there's no option to filter the list. This is by intention. Discovering music is beautiful,
and genres kind of prevent this. Thats why there is no filter, but a track preview button.

### Submitting concerts

You are invited, to take part in this project by sharing and adding your favourite concerts and "Geheimtipps".
Nothing is bad. If you like it, others will too.

After you've send a submission, it will be flagged as _not verified_. This means that I haven't had time to check if the concert is actually real.
_Sometimes this may take a while._

### Highlighted concerts

All submissions are being reviewed by a team of users. When viewing the list with highlighting activated,
some concerts are presented a little more prominent, based on those users musical taste.

This feature is meant to work as some kind of recommendation system, is not limited to genres and does of course
not necessarily represent everyones musical taste.

If you don't want this kind of curation, you can disable the highlighting
by clicking the button at the top of the list, at any time.
