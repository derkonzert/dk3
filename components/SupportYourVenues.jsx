        This website is all about concerts and you probably love going to
        concerts as much as I do. But currently, all the people being involved
        in making these events happen, great artists, organizers, venues, labels
        and many more, face very hard times.

      <Text mv="m">
        So, please — if you are able to — support them in any possible way, so
        that we can have great concerts in the future.
