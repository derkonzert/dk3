## What is dk3?

### Vision

**dk3** is the platform, that will become the future version of _[derkonzert.de](https://derkonzert.de)_, an open community for concerts in Munich (Germany). It's basically an open list of events, curated by its users. It's _non-commercial_ and _not genre specific_.

### Status

This is a side project of [@jkempff](https://github.com/jkempff) and is currently in the making. Therefore this README is to be considered _WIP_.

_The current version of the derkonzert project runs on a completely different codebase and is not publicly available._

### Included libraries

#### UI Components

All UI components are part of the `@dk3/ui` package, and are documented using [docz](https://www.docz.site/). A (for now not automatically) deployed version can be found here: [https://ui.dk3.tech](https://ui.dk3.tech).
